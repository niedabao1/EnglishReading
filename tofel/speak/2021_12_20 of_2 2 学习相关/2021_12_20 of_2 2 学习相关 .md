### q:

Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?

### s:

To me, I definitely think that is better to have a deeper understanding  of one area because focus on one area can make you be professional.

I remember when I was undergraduate, I try to learning 4 course in one term. obvious in the end, I hung up my all subjects, So I decide just took my energy put on computer science. At the end, because my firm coding ability, I become a engineer at Xunfei  technical  company.

The other reason is the starting part when you learning new subject is hardest. so, If you hovering on the different subject, you can't get fun from learning something, It's just painful. 

So to sum up, if I have choose, I would definitely focus on a single subject.
