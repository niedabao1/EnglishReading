I agree with the opinion that my friends are the most important influence in my life.

First of all, friends and parents are the closest people around me . Because parents are older than offspring 20 to 30 years, so most parents opinions are antiquated. Furthermore, you can talk with your friends about digital games, college curriculum and lovely girls or boys. and thus friends are the prime influence in my life.

Second, friends can study or work with me. For example, Once on campus, I can't figure out my liner algebra practice. Then I work with my friends to solve the puzzle, finally we conquer the problem and absorb the thought behind this puzzle.
