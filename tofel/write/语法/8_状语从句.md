# 状语从句

其用于修饰的主句或主句的谓语。一般可分为<u>九大类</u>：

* 时间

* 地点

* 原因

* 目的

* 结果

* 条件

* 让步

* 比较

关键是要掌握引导不同状语从句的常用连接词和特殊连接词。

## 时间状语从句

#### 引导词

1. 常用：when, as, while, as soon as, before, after, since, till, until

2. 特殊: the minute, the moment, the second, every time, the day, the instant, immediately, directly, no sooner...than, hardly...when, scarcely...when
* when the audience enjoy horse racing or bull fighting, the animals are suffering.

* We violate an animal's <u>rights the minute</u> we catch it for the purpose of our entertainment.

一...就...：

hardly/scarcely...when/before, no sooner...than 和 as soon as

* As soon as the food web is broken, the whole ecosystem could be forever changed.

如果hardly/scarcely...when/before, no sooner...than在句首，则句子必须用倒装结构。

* No sooner do children raise a pet they develop a caring mind.

#### 比较 while, when, as

1. as, when引导短暂性动作的动词。
* <u>When trees are cut down and natural habitats destroyed</u>, we should protect wild animals from dying out.
2. while 只能表示 "在一段时间或过程中"， 只能表示一段时间，其后面一般用**进行时**或**表示状态**的结构.
* While we save endangered species, we are interfering with the evolutionary process.

#### 比较 until 和 till

这两个词意思相同。

肯定形式意为：*做某事直至某时* 

肯定句的动词必须是延续性的。

否定形式意为：*直到某时才做某事*

否定句的动词有延续性，不可延续性都可。

1. 肯定句

The issue of animal welfare should be kept out of our focus until we satisfy our own needs.

2. 否定句

Until 可用于句首，而till通常不用于句首。

Until developing countries can realize self-reliance, the protection of biodiversity is a luxury to them.

tip：否定句可用另外两种句式表示。

1. Not until...在句首，这时主句倒装
* <u>Not until the early years of the 19th century</u> did man know what damages he had caused to mother nature.
2. It is not until...that...(强调句型)
* It is not until raising a pet that people realize that it is a costly and time-consuming hobby.

## 地点状语从句

2. 特殊:seeing that, now that, in that, considering that, given that, inasmuch as, insomuch as

Those who are weaker are to be exploited because we can do so.

#### 比较 because, since, as 和 for

Because 语势最强，表客观必然原因，用于回答人们所不知的原因，例如why提出的问题。

当原因是显而易见或为人所知，用as或since。

for的语气最轻，表示主观原因，或猜测可能的原因。?for放句首? 

人所不知的原因

* Animal kept are housed in unnatural surroundings **because** zoos are shorts of financial support.

推测的原因，用for

* Human beings must have the need for animal experiments, **for** they have exited for thousands of years.

## 结果状语从句

2. **特殊: to the degree that, to the extent that, to such a degree that**
* Animal activists are <u>such</u> extremists <u>that they don't even care about human welfare.</u>

#### 比较 so 和 such

so与such词性不同:

such是形容词，修饰名词或名词词组

so 是副词，只能修饰形容词或副词，还可以组成固定搭配。

* Although zoos are not completely rural, they can introduce urban citizens to the real experience of other species.

#### as, though 引导的倒装句

as 和 though 引导的让步从句必须表语或状语提前(形容词，副词，分词，实义动词)

* <u>Weaker species </u>as/though animal are, they are an inseparable link of out ecosystems.

* Dog lovers treat their dogs <u>the way they may treat their children</u>.

#### as 和 (just) as...so...

* Just as we protect less able human beings, so we should safeguard the welfare of other weaker species.

#### as if 和 as though

意义相同，从句谓语**多用虚拟语气**， 表示与事实相反；

有时也用陈述语气，表示所说的情况是事实或可能是事实。意思是 “仿佛...似的”
