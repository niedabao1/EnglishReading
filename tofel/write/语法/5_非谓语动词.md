# 非谓语动词

非谓语动词不受主语人称和数的限制，但具有动词的某些特征，不仅可接受宾语，还有时态和语态的变化。

其具体的表现形式有以下四种：

* 动词不定式 `to + V`

    **一般用以表示目的和结果，或某个具体的动作。**

* 动名词 `V-ing`
  
  **一般用来表现动作的主体概念和进行意义。(动词当名词用)**

* 现在分词 `V-ing`

**一般用来表现动作正在进行这个概念。**

* 过去分词 `V-ed`
  
  **表示动作的被动和完成。**

## 动词不定式

**其可做主语，表语，宾语，宾语补足语，定语和状语。**

### 作主语

* <u>To telecommute</u> usually means to work at home.

* <u>To lie</u> in childhood may lead to a crime in adulthood.

### 作宾语

* Most weight losers decide <u>to have</u> a vegetarian diet.

(P97)常见做宾语的词

### 作表语

* The most effective solution is <u>to enhance</u> the public's awareness of the rubbish problem.

由 all, what引导的主语从句或者主语被 only, first, one, least或形容词最高级修饰时，且从句中含有do时，其表语如果是动词不定式，则往往省去to。

* What the elders should do is <u>take</u> a rest and <u>enjoy </u>their late years.

* the only thing women could do in Middle Age was <u>give</u> birth to children and <u>attend</u> to the whole family.

### 作补语

* Men have all alone educated women <u>to consider</u> themselves inferior.

在以下情况接不带 to 的动词不定式：

感官动词如 fell, listen, hear, look at, notice, see, watch, observe, perceive等后面.

个别使役意义的动词后面: have, let , make.

一些情态动词后面: had better,would rather...than..., ,rather than,may well do.

## 动名词

### 作主语

* <u>Switching</u> jobs too quickly may ruin one's career.

这些以 it 作形式主语或形式宾语的句型中，用动名词作逻辑主语或逻辑宾语。

    It is no use (no good, no point, no sense, a waste of time等) + doing sth.

    It is good(nice, interesting, useless等形容词) + doing sth.

    There is no point(use, sense, good等名词) + doing sth.

* It is no point <u>having</u> a vegetable diet.

### 作宾语

直接用动名词做宾语的动词见p102:

* Education department should **forbid** <u>limiting </u>the number of female students in some majors.

在这些动词中： allow, advice, forbid, permit, recommend 有"要求"含义的动词在以人做宾语时，后接不定式做宾语补足语。如 ：`allow + sb.+ to do sth`

* Most of the parents forbid their children <u>to smoke</u>.

### 作介词宾语

The advantages  are <u>surpassed by</u> those of experiencing different jobs.

(p103) 这些短语to为介词，后面只能接动名词或名词。

* I am looking forward to <u>seeing</u> you again.

在这些动词后既可以接不定式，也可接动名词。在接不定式时表事情尚未发生，接动名词表事情已经发生在动词之前。

 `remember to do sth`         记得将要去做某事

`remember doing sth`          记得已经做过某事

* Place remember <u>to write</u> me.

* I remember <u>losing</u> my briefcase in the subway station.

这一些列的词有： remember, forget, stop, go on, try, mean, regret(后悔)。

## 现代分词

### 作表语

* The reason for smoking ban sounds convincing.

### 作定语

### 作补语

* Career women should have work and household chores well <u>dealt </u>with.

谓语动词的独立主格结构见 other_1。分词的独立结构前也可以有 with, without或there。with本身没有词义，there实际上是引导词，being后面的名词才是分词的逻辑主语。

* Everything taken into consideration, mandatory retirement is a brutal violation of the elders' right to work.

分词短语的固定表达方式一般不受主语一致的限制。分词短语见 p111.

* Honestly speaking, frequent job switching does no good to one's career development.
