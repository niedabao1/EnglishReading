4. **should + 动词原形**

#### 作介词的宾语

不及物动词后面必须接介词，例如：care about..., figure out...等

#### 作形容词的宾语

that引导的从句常常跟在以下形容词后:

* anxious, aware, certain, confident, determined, glad, proud, surprised, worried, sorry, thankful, ashamed, disappointed, annoyed, pleased, hurt, satisfied 和 content等.

也可将此类词后的 that 从句看作<u>原因状语从句</u>。

#### 否定转移

若主语谓语动词为 think, consider, suppose, believe, expect, fancy, guess, imagine, 其后的宾语从句有否定的意思，一般把否定词转移到主句谓语上，从句谓语用肯定式。

* The poor will not consider that the co-called elite culture is available for all to enjoy.

## 表语从句

在复合句中作表语，放在系动词后，结构是 `主语+连系动词+表语动词`（that可省略）。可接表语从句的连系动词有：

be, look, remain, seem, the reason is that..., It is because 等

* This is why TV commercials are regarded as rubbish.

## 同位语从句

同位语： 一个名词(或其它形式)对另一个名词或代词进行解释或补充说明，这个名词（或其它形式）就是**同位语**。 **同位语**与被它限定的词的格式要一致，并常常紧挨在一起。 **同位语**除表示其**同位**成分的全部意义外，还可以表示部分意义。

形式：`抽象名词 + that 从句` ，that不充当任何成分。

抽象名词： news, idea, fact, doubt, evidence, promise, rumor, hope, truth, belief, message等

#### 同位语从句对抽象名词解释

* The view that language extinction will give rise to cultural disaster is an exaggeration.

#### 同位语从句与定语从句的区别

1. 定语从句中that既代替先行词，又在从句中作某个成分（主&宾）; 而同位语从句中that是连词，不充当成分。

2. 定语从句有形容词性，所以其功能是修饰先行词，对其限定，描述性质或特征；同位语从句是名词性的，其是对名词进行补充说明。

第一个that为定语从句，在从句中作主语

* the view that prevails among parents and educators is that TV presents a false picture of reality to children prevails among parents and educators.
