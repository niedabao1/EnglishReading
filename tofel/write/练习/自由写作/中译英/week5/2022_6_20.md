Zoos are the ideal research center where scientist find causes for diseases.

Some people choose to have a vegetarian diet so that animal suffering can be reduced.

Although there is some problem with conserving endangered species in zoos, we have tried our best.

we should treat the wildlife kindly because they are an **indispensable** part of the ecosystem.

No matter what benefits animals test has, it s unacceptable.

Bull fighting and dog fighting are so cruel that people consider them **barbaric** and uncivilized sports. 

If a kid learning to kindly and patiently treat with his pat, he can learning treat with people in the same way.
