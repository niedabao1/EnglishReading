Why? Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.



I prefer to take course(courses) by professors who I know, because that make me feel confortable expecially(especially) When I face new subject(subjects). I will try to give some proof from the courese(course) and professor in the after context.
First of all, It is important that learning(to learn) new stuff from the enviroment(environment) that you already know. When I learn something that I did not kown(know) before, a fermiliar(familiar) teacher can help me to understand the unkown(unknow) thing quickly. Further more(furthermore), learning (a) new subject usually fell(fells) painful, but with you last term's professor together can help you relax from this situation.
Second, if (the) professor konw(knows) my study situation in past years, he will know my study habit. That means (a) teacher can easily help you. For exemple(example), My cousin join(joined) the computer course group, he can(could) not follow(keep up with) other students first time, but the teacher in the group (was) familiar with him before. The teacher point(pointed) out his weakness and help(helped) him repair those thing, Finally he get(got) the 1st pride from this study group. 
I konw(know) someone say(says) that learning from the professor you do not know will give you an angle that think(thinks) course(courses) from different ways. But learning a new subject is diffcult(difficult), if you can not(cannot) finish it first time, the course will cause mental damage. So, I think learning from your familiar professor is more fittful(fitful).
