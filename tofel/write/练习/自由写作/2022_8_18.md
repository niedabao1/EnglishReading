Some people say that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable
 information. Others think access to so much information creates 
problems. Which view do you agree with?



It is hard to deny that Internet corporate lots of commercial and political advertises, and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that access too many Internet information creates problem. As far as Internet connect us with the world, promote human's productivity, I agree the opinion that Internet has positive influence.
