In modern society, the expectation of young people is too high. The high standard of adults gives them a bunch of mental stress and debt. But some people point out that high expectation let people better than before, I disagree, and my reasons and examples are given blow.
First of all, more than *half of* adults suffer mental illness because of the high expectation. Modern lifestyle is complicated, that means young man can only achieve part of expectation with personal lifestyle now. Further more, if adults want to become excellent, mental illness and pressure will follow him.
In addition, the high expectation will increase the risk of personal financial problems. High status means high risk. For the expect, young people put risk of failures on their back. For example, my cousin is an undergraduate. He participates in the university business plan competition because his family expect it. But He failed in the competition because the tournament chairman did not like his plan, then he lost one year of college life.
Nevertheless, the voice arises that because of the high expectation, young people usually get high ability of work skill. Ironically, that skill is just a mechanical skill, not creative skill. Therefore, the expectation of young people is too high.
