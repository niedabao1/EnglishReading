### review

When the day off, you back home with your tired body and the mind that endure your boss meaningless talk. However, the most mainstream voice still advises you to do some aerobic sport. It sounds good, but hard to keep for people who suffer busy work all day. So I think reading a book it's a suitable way in your free time to relax because the tired thing is not only your body but also your brain.

The melody of the 21st-century city is so fast, your skill may be enough for today but maybe outdated in next decade, so keep learning it's an effective way if you want to keep up the new technology step. Spend a lot of time on sport seems haven't had this effect. Shape mind it's better than solid body neither in ancient and in modern.
