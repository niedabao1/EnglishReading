First, eccess in sport could despoil family's harmorly. 
Because there should be a place that people though the way of listening, expressing and helping care each other, but pay attention on sport too much abslutely Take "quality time" from all famility members. 
Try image this scene,the wife want ask her husband about hiself job change, but the huaband seems cool. 
then the wife find out her husband brain is full with football match, already no space listen his wife voice.

Second, pay attention to sport showes and teams too much will influence healty. pay attention to something usually need price. people chase sport stars and tournement is pay time from rest and exceice. for example, I got a neiborhoot, he is a crazy football fan. he watches scoll tournement on 2010 night. indefissent sleep and work stress broken down his body, and cause hardly heart disease.

In other way, whatch sport TV shows and focus on favourite sport team can bring a lot of benefits. such as on sociality location, sport can become talking stuff of new friends. have some information on sport help social communication. but, if we can't belence our time, let our fanaticism overtake the time belong work, excecise and talking with family, then will cause undesirable consequence.
