A few years ago, a researcher reported a strange anomaly beneath the ice in Wilkes Land- evidence of what may be a mascon.

When an asteroid hits Earth, when it **slams** into Earth's crust, we think 
that causes molten rock from deep below the surface to rise up into the 
impact area- sort of like if you bump your head, you get a big **lump** 
under the skin... fluid makes the area swell.

And we have rock samples from the Bedout High- some apparently of **extraterrestrial** origin.
