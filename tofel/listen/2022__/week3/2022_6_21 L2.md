  Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this **topographical** map 
  of…Well, the gray-and-white area toward the bottom is the South Pole. 
  The purples and blues in the middle correspond to low **elevations**--the 
  SPA Basin itself. Uh, the oranges and reds around it are higher 
  elevations.

The Basin measures an amazing 2,500 kilometers in diameter, and its 
average depth is 12 kilometers. That makes it the biggest known **crater** 
in our solar system. And it may well be the oldest.

And, in this case, we especially want to know if any of the mantle, the layer **beneath** the crust, was exposed by the impact.

But that's not very precise. If we had rock samples to study, we'd know 
whether these small craters were formed by **impacts** during the final 
stages of planetary formation,

So, water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining Moon base 
someday, a mining camp, perhaps, or, uh, a **departure** point for further 
space exploration.
