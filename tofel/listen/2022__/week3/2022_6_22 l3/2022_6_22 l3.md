But she's got a problem: She's not absolutely certain it's an original.  So what do you do? How do you **determine** whether the painting's authentic?

determine    查明

So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas--his **brushstrokes**, how thickly he applied his paint--so you'd need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's style.

Now, a word or two about restoration. Sometimes, original artworks appear questionable or **inauthentic** because they've had so many restorers add **touch-up** layers to cover up damage--damage from the paint having deteriorated over time.

inauthentic             不真实的

touch-up                 润色
