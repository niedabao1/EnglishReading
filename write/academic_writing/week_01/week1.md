### 2. Examples of what not to do

 adoptive cell transfer, immunotherapy is based on the ex vivo selection of tumor-reactive lymphocytes, and their activation and numerical expression before reinfusion to the autologous tumor-bearing host.in the above paragraph, it's hard to read.

* the scientific literature should be enjoyable.

Is it written to inform or to obscure.



Because verbs drives sentences whereas nouns slow them down.

so read again:

 adoptive cell transfer, immunotherapy is based on the ex vivo **selection** of tumor-reactive lymphocytes, and their **activation** and numerical **expression** before **reinfusion** to the autologous tumor-bearing host.



tips:

* Complex ideas don't require complex language.
* Scientific writing should be easy and enjoyable to read!

### 3. Overview, principles of effective writing

example:

```
dysregulation of physiologic microRNA, miR, activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. and follow transcript0:37Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.
```

avoid use some vague words.



#### specific principles of effective writing

* Cut unnecessary words and phrases(cutting clutter); learn to part with your words
* Use the active voice(Subject + verb + object)

### 4. Cut the clutter

"The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function,every long word that could be a short word,every adverb that carries the meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what--these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank"
