# A Trump bombshell quietly dropped last week. And it should shock us all





we’ve become so **inured** to Donald Trump’s proto-fascism that we barely blink an eye when we learn that he tried to manipulate the 2020 election. Yet the most recent revelation should frighten every American to their core.

On Friday, the House oversight committee [released](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/30/donald-trump-doj-officials-2020-election-memos-house-oversight) notes of a 27 December telephone call from Trump to then acting **attorney** general Jeffrey Rosen, in which Trump told Rosen: “Just say the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R **congressmen**.” The notes were taken by Richard Donoghue, Rosen’s **deputy**, who was also on the call.

The release of these notes has barely made a **stir**. The weekend news was filled with more immediate things – **infrastructure**! The Delta strain! Inflation! Wildfires! In light of everything else going on, Trump’s **bizarre** efforts in the last weeks of his **presidency** seem wearily irrelevant. Didn’t we already know how **desperate** he was?

In a word, no. This revelation is hugely important.

Rosen obviously rejected Trump’s request. But what if Rosen had obeyed Trump and said to the American public that the election was corrupt – and then “left the rest” to Trump and the Republican congressmen? What would Trump’s and the Republicans’ next moves have been? And which Republican congressmen were in **cahoots** with Trump in this attempted coup d’état?

Make no mistake: this was an attempted coup.

Trump knew it. Just weeks earlier, then attorney general William Barr said the justice department had found no evidence of widespread **fraud** that could have overturned the results.

And a few days after Trump’s call to Rosen – on 2 January – Trump told Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to “find” votes to change the election outcome. He **berated** Raffensperger for not doing more to overturn the election.

Emails released last month also show that Trump and his allies in the last weeks of his presidency pressured the justice department to investigate totally unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud – forwarding them **conspiracy** theories and even a draft legal brief they hoped would be filed with the supreme court.

Some people, especially Republican officeholders, believe we should simply forget these **sordid** details. We must not.

For the first time in the history of the United States we did not have a peaceful transition of power. For the first time in American history, a president refused – still refuses – to concede, and continues to claim, with no basis in fact, that the election was “stolen” from him. For the first time in history, a president actively plotted a coup.

It would have been bad enough were Trump a **mere** **crackpot** acting on his own pathetic stage – a would-be **dictator** who accidentally became president and then, when he lost re-election, went bonkers – after which he was swept into the **dustbin** of history.

We might then merely regret this temporary **lapse** in American presidential history. At best, Trump would be seen as a fool and the whole affair an **embarrassment** to the country.

But Trump was no accident and he’s not in any dustbin. He has turned one of America’s two major parties into his own cult. He has cast the major political division in the US as a clash between those who believe him about the 2020 election and those who do not. He has emboldened state Republicans to execute the most brazen attack on voting rights since Jim Crow. Most Republican senators and representatives dare not cross him. Some of his followers continue to threaten violence against the government. By all accounts, he is running for president again in 2024.

Donald Trump’s proto-fascism poses the largest internal threat to American democracy since the civil war.

What to do about it? Fight it, and the sooner the better.

This final revelation – Trump’s 27 December call to the acting **attorney** general in which he pleads “Just say the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me” – should trigger section 3 of the 14th **amendment**, which bars anyone from holding office who “engaged in insurrection” against the US. The current attorney general of the United States, Merrick Garland, should issue an **advisory** opinion clearly stating this. If Trump wants to take it to the supreme court, fine.
