#### Fevre dream  P7

His pupils were pinpoints, burning black, and they reached right
into Marsh and weighed the soul inside him. The gray around
them seemed alive, moving, like fog on the river on a dark
night, when the banks vanish and the lights vanish and there
is nothing in the world but your boat and the river and the
fog. In those mists, Abner Marsh saw things; visions
swift-glimpsed and then gone. There was a cool intelligence
peering out of those mists. But there was a beast as well, dark
and frightening, chained and angry, raging at the fog. Laughter
and loneliness and cruel passion; York had all of that in his
eyes.
