### conclusion

1. COVID-19 Delta variant is more predominant.
2. even inject the vaccinate. Delta variant still makes this one got covid-19.
3. The virus got an evolutionary advantage.
4. it can copy itself quickly.
5. it has increase transmissibility.
6. researchers try to finger out properties that cause the Covid-19 variant to be popular.
7. the Gamma variant have been high in Brazil
8. the kappa variant, just the D variant, ended up taking off but not spread worldwide.
9. it hard to predict the "best" mutations of the virus, even find but don't know they preform
10. Cooper says, "people need to vaccinate."
11. the variant call B.1.620 from African could have increase transmissibility.
12. new mRNA vaccines will be more effective.

### sentence

Delta’s emergence has caused a number of countries to reinstate travel and mask **restrictions** that had been loosened as vaccination rates rose

 “It was a bit of a surprise that it was the Delta variant that ended up taking off,” Suthar says. “It was actually comforting.”

there may be a limit to how many mutations a virus can acquire on the spike protein before it is no longer able to bind to the ACE2 receptor
